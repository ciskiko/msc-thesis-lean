# Formalization in the Lean Theorem Prover

This repository contains code developed as part of my MSc thesis in Applied Mathematics and Computation at Instituto Superior Técnico (2024–2025).

## Description

The project focuses on formalizing results from group theory using the Lean theorem prover and mathlib.

Main aspects:
- formalization of algebraic structures and theorems, concerning the regular wreath product
- development of machine-checked proofs
- proof refactoring and abstraction
- interaction with mathlib

## Topics

Lean, mathlib, theorem proving, formal verification, dependent type theory.

## Notes

This repository reflects research and proof-engineering work rather than traditional software development.
